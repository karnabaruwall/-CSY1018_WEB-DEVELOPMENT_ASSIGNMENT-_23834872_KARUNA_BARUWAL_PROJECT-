            <h1> Experience on Learning Basics of HTML</h1>
<p> At the starting I was very excited to learn and know about the basics of HTML and CSS. During the very beginning everything looked easy and I was very confident that I could do the works that uses HTML and CSS. But after doing one exercise or two I faced problems and I felt demotivated. I used to make very minor errors and get frustrated as I could not find where I made the mistake. Eventually after doing same thing over and over again I started getting back my confidence and also could catch the errors I made and eventually stopped making minor errors. I would not say it was easy to begin but I did cope up and now am confident that I can make a simple website and can tackle every problem I might be facing during the coding period. Finally, I would say that this experience has made me more patient and has improved my problem-solving skills. I learned many things and am looking forward to learning more. </p>
